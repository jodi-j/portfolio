			"I recently completed the NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy, where I took on the role of Deputy Project Manager of Resources. In this academy, I collaborated with a multi-discplinary collegiate team in order to plan a discovery-class mission aimed at exploring lunar resources. As the leader of the Programmatics sub-team, I was responsible for ensuring that the costs, schedule, and risks for the mission were properly researched and followed the mission's constraints. By working closely with the Science and Engineering sub-teams, we successfully planned a mission concept for a lunar rover that would inspect volatiles and in-sita resources on the Moon's surface.",
