		description:
			"I've worked on a variety of projects over the years and I'm proud of the progress I've made. Many of these projects are open-source and available for others to explore and contribute to. If you're interested in any of the projects I've worked on, please feel free to check out the code and suggest any improvements or enhancements you might have in mind. Collaborating with others is a great way to learn and grow, and I'm always open to new ideas and feedback.",

			"As a senior Computer Science student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, I've taken a multitude of courses that have provided me with a solid foundation in the topics of computer science and software engineering. At the university, I was a member of the operations team for Hack Dearborn 3, hosted by the Google Developer Student Club, which saw the participation of 300+ hackers at 42 universities across the country at our hackathon. Currently, I am a member of the operations team for the POWER Conference, hosted by the Society of Women Engineers and scheduled for March of 2025.",

			"I have had 3 internships throughout my college career. In fields ranging from automotive, to aerospace, to fin-tech, I have gained experience in the engineering industry. I was a Product Engineering Intern at the Woodbridge Foam Corporation, a Software Engineering Intern at ispace, inc., and am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Rocket Mortgage.",
		para3: 
			"I recently completed the NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy, where I took on the role of Deputy Project Manager of Resources. In this academy, I collaborated with a multi-discplinary collegiate team in order to plan a discovery-class mission aimed at exploring lunar resources. As the leader of the Programmatics sub-team, I was responsible for ensuring that the costs, schedule, and risks for the mission were properly researched and followed the mission's constraints. By working closely with the Science and Engineering sub-teams, we successfully planned a mission concept for a lunar rover that would inspect volatiles and in-sita resources on the Moon's surface.",
